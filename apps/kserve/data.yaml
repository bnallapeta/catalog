    k0rdent facilitates the deployment and lifecycle management of KServe within Kubernetes clusters by leveraging its multi-cluster orchestration capabilities.
    KServe provides a Kubernetes-native platform for serving and managing machine learning models with high performance and scalability.
    
    KServe builds on Kubernetes to provide a standardized, scalable, and reliable solution for deploying, monitoring, and managing 
    machine learning models in production. With features like traffic management, canary deployments, and autoscaling, KServe enables 
    seamless deployment of models across various frameworks including TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost, and ONNX.
    
    Through k0rdent, users can easily install and manage KServe CRDs, which serve as the foundation for enabling KServe's model serving capabilities.
    This integration streamlines the process of deploying and managing ML models on Kubernetes, providing a centralized control plane
    to manage KServe installations, monitor health, and enforce policies across multiple clusters.
    
    By deploying KServe from the catalog, k0rdent enables users to build and scale ML inference services while leveraging Kubernetes-native infrastructure.
